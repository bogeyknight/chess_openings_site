   Opis: The Grunfeld Defense is named for GM Ernst Grunfeld, a leading opening theorist of his day. He began playing it in several games in 1922, including a win over Alexander Alekhine with it in Vienna (which apparently made enough of an impression on Alekhine that he tried it himself in the same tournament, only to lose in 26 moves).
